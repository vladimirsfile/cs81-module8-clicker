# Cookie Clicker Reflection



## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

I understood that when we want to interact with the browser we use the DOM. By using "document." we can interact with the website. 

## How did you choose your milestone messages?

I chose my messages based on the severity of the situation. The more cats we added to the picture, the crazier it gets. 

## What challenge or bug surprised you?

I initially faced the if statement logic. Instead of starting with "if (count >= 100)", I started with "if (count >= 10)" at the very top. So the condition would have stayed true for all the numbers above or equal to 10.

## What personal twist did you add?

I modified the project into a Cat Clicker. Along with changing the cookies with cats, as the counter increases, I added a background color that deepens from teal to purple, to match the intensity. I also had to change the font color when the background color turned purple for better readability. 

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

Crypto and Stock Exchange apps use this kind of interaction. When the price moves, the code checks if it is up or down and then changes the color between red and green. It is the same idea with the Cat clicker, changing the background color and the counter changes.
